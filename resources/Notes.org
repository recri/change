* Finding little typos all over the place.
** Curiously, the name of the hexagram is ALL CAPS
   in every Judgment, except for 31. Influence (Wooing)
   where it is normal case.  I'm changing that in my
   text to match all the other uses.
* Extracted Wilhelm's original german text
  need to do a thorough proofreading to ensure that the
  extraction went as well as it appears.
* Translated Wilhelm's text into english with google docs
  Also needs a thorough proofreading, but the following are
  already apparent:
** no upper case on the initial line of the judgment and the line judgements
   is often beginning with lower case.
   Fix automatically.
** comma at the beginning of a line
   Fix automatically
*** the 6th line of 16
*** the 6th line of 24
*** the 3rd line of 30
*** the 3rd line of 32
*** the 3rd line of 37
*** the 4th line of 38
*** the 3rd line of 44
** the name of 4 is left as Jugendtorheit
   Youthful folly, or wild oats
** The Receptive is capitalized, the creative is not,
** the judgement of 2 has 'isto' and 'encouragingin'
** the first line of 4 has 'fool' pushed to the next line
** the 3rd line of 44 lost its colon,
   pulled there into the line introduction
