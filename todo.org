** progessive web app of the I Ching
** url a string of two digit octal numbers from 00 to 77 (0 to 63 decimal)
   each two digit octal number corresponding to one of the 64 hexagrams
** display the text of the I Ching for each hexagram
   and the changing lines for each transition
   and hot link the commentary, 
*** The url splits into hexagrams
    and the differences between adjacent hexagrams encode moving lines.
    Hence split into a list of hexagrams and insert the moving lines
    into the list.
    The hexagrams become hexagram cards identified by octal numbers
    from 0 to 77, and the xor of the adjacent hexagrams has ones for
    moving lines and zeroes for stationary lines.
    The moving lines become interpolated change lines identified by
    the preceding hexagram and a power of two for the moving line.
    There is the bonus moving line where all lines are moving.
*** The hexagram property of the content card indexes a database
    of content which may be the Wilhelm/Baynes text or something else.
*** <change-hexagram content="[0-7][0-7]">
*** <change-line content="[0-7][0-7]
    So the content is simply a sequence of {hex, {line}*}* 
** controls
*** cast -> append a new hexagram to the url
*** undo -> remove the last hexagram from the url
*** redo -> restore the last hexagram to the url
*** over -> start over
** animation
*** cast is two steps, 
    the time between initiation and completion
    seeds the random number generator 
    which selects the lines of the cast
*** or the cast requires a commit to select each line
* rewrite the text without gender stereotypes
  the better person, the dependent, ...
  the dog owner and the dog
  surface the original wilhem-baynes translation.
* try running the chinese through google translate?
